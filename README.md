# Mail Status tracker

**Suppose**, you have applied for a job through an email. You have sent the email two days ago but you haven't gotten any response. And you don't know if the employer read your email or not. Well no need to worry now because I have a solution for that, **introducing Mail Status Tracker**.

**Mail Status Tracker** is an  project designed to help users track the status of their sent emails. With Mail Status Tracker, you can determine whether your email has been read by the recipient, providing peace of mind and valuable insights into your email communications.

## Introduction

Have you ever sent an important email and wondered if the recipient has read it? With Mail Status Tracker, you no longer have to guess. Mail Status Tracker is a simple and privacy-focused platform that allows you to track the status of your sent emails without requiring full email read/write access. Our solution respects your privacy while providing the information you need.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Nhost, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles.
- **Email Tracking**: Embed a tracking pixel in your emails to monitor when they are opened. The tracking pixel sends a request to the server, updating the emailâ€™s status to "seen".

- **Serverless Functions**: Utilize Nhost serverless functions to handle backend logic for updating email statuses.
